`%tower` stores a configurable url+timestamp for media and relays chat messages to all subscribers.

`%tuner` provides a static tuned-in station with chatbox to arbitrary observers who log in with an rbit id

## UI

the radio frontend uses the react-player npm library to play media based on a url+timestamp.

every radio station has its own chatroom. to interact with radio, users type commands into chat.
